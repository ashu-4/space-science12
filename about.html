					<h1>About</h1>
					<h2>Space exploration</h2>
					<p>Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space.
						 While the exploration of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, 
						 its physical exploration is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight.
						  Space exploration, like its classical form astronomy, is one of the main sources for space science.

					<h2>Targets of exploration</h2>
					<p>Starting in the mid-20th century probes and then human mission were sent into Earth orbit, and then on to the Moon.
						 Also, probes were sent throughout the known Solar System, and into Solar orbit. Uncrewed spacecraft have been sent into orbit around Saturn,
						  Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury by the 21st century, and the most distance active spacecraft, Voyager 1 and 2 traveled beyond 100 times the Earth-Sun distance. 
						  The instruments were enough though that it is thought 
						they have left the Sun's heliosphere, a sort of bubble of particles made in the Galaxy by the Sun's solar wind.</p>

					<h2>Asteroids</h2>
					<p>Until the advent of space travel, objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes,
						 their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery. Several asteroids have now been visited by probes, the first of which was Galileo, which flew past two: 951 Gaspra in 1991,
						  followed by 243 Ida in 1993. Both of these lay near enough to Galileo's planned trajectory to Jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost.</p>

					<h2>Future of space exploration</h2>
					<p>Breakthrough Starshot is a research and engineering project by the Breakthrough Initiatives to develop a proof-of-concept fleet of light sail spacecraft named StarChip,
						 to be capable of making the journey to the Alpha Centauri star system 4.37 light-years away. It was founded in 2016 by Yuri Milner, Stephen Hawking, and Mark Zuckerberg</p>
